# scratch-archive
a (partially) complete repo with scratch versions 1.0.x to 1.4 (with betas)

props to [djdolphin](https://github.com/djdolphin) for making old archives that, sadly, don't exist anymore

without:
* [djdolphin](https://github.com/djdolphin) (old scratch archives)
* [the wayback machine](https://archive.org) (used to obtain images from old dropbox links)
* [llk.media.mit.edu](https://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/software/scratch/) (Scratch13Oct04)

this would be impossible.

more details [here](https://github.com/xubiod/scratch-archive)
