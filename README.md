# scratch-archive
a (partially) complete repo with scratch versions 1.0.x to 1.4 (with betas)

props to @djdolphin for making old archives that, sadly, don't exist anymore

without:
  @djdolphin (old scratch archives)
  [archive.org](the wayback machine) (used to obtain images from old dropbox links)
  [https://llk.media.mit.edu/courses/software/scratch/](llk.media.mit.edu) (Scratch13Oct04)
this would be impossible.

Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.
The Scratch Cat is an image of Scratch from MIT.

I am not claiming to have made these, this is just a hosting repository.
